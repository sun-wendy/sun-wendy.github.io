I'm a third-year undergrad at MIT studying AI & Math. I'm interested in building provably safe AI systems, specifically _interpreting & verifying_ neural networks.

Research
======
I currently work on evaluating LLM's capability at writing formally verifiable code at <a href="https://tegmark.org/" target="_blank">Max Tegmark's group</a>.

This summer, I'm also interning at Center for Human-Compatible AI (CHAI) and working on avoiding side effects in RL environments.
